A proof-of-concept style (incomplete) Pokemon Firered clone.

Runs a significant portion of firered internals on the EVM, suitable for a proof-of-stake chain variant such as Polygon or Ronin.
Uses assets ripped from Firered, and a sample animation atlas.
Uses ideas from [this](https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6) to construct parts of the open world.
Uses Tiled to construct and import maps into Phaser.js.
